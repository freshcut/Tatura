# Tatura
__The ultimate CSS framework for beginners__

If you've ever found yourself stuck when writing CSS, you're not alone. It's hard. Tatura aims to help you learn to resolve this problem, all in one tiny CSS file.

## Super-tiny
Weighing in at just under 500 bytes, Tartura is the perfect framework: it doesn't add a millisecond of extra page load, doesn't cause any extra rendering/paint time. I guess you could say it does nothing!

## Cross-browser
Tartura's agile nature means you're never going to have problems. It's the only framework that supports every single browser, even the browsers that don't support CSS.

## Beautiful
As with <a href="//anchorcms.com">anything</a> <a href="//visualidiot.com">I</a> <a href="//typestacks.com">make</a>, it's beautiful. For most people, that'd be obnoxious and arrogant, but this code truly is perfect; it's the zen of CSS.

## Open to the world
It's WTPL, so frolick in the fields with Tartura, and it's cool. Just be nice.

## Got any questions?
Although support for this framework is 100% not needed, I do take help/feature requests. Just add 'em to the issue log.
